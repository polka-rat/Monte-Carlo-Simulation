## Used Monte Carlo Simulation to price a European call option 
Got the mean expected discounted payoff after multiple iterations and then verfiied it with the analytical approach (using Black Scholes Formula). Also compared it with real life call option price.

## Simulated portfolios using Monte Carlo Methods
Ran some set number of iterations on a correlated set of stocks and observed its pattern. Also computed its VaR (Value at Risk) and CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)

This was more of a learning activity for me. Learnt a lot of stuff ranging from what an arbitrage is to what are Ito's Lemma. Will definitely try out more stuff in this domain
